## Data Exploration using Big Query 
### Project 1 - [Covid 19 Death and Vaccination Data](https://github.com/aathira-p/SQL-Data-Expoloration-Projects/blob/main/SQL_data_exploration1.sql) 

The Covid-19 data from [Covid-data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) is analysed using BigQuery 
This helped me practice the following *skills* 
1. Create Project in Bigquery 
2. Upload Data 
3. Basic Query functions, CAST/CONVERT,
4. Perform and analyse simple calculations like percentage of covid deaths (grouped by locations) of the total cases, percentage of population vaccinated, Locations with highest infection rate etc. 
5. Join Tables 
6. Using CTE 
7. Create Tables 


### Project 2 - [How Much Energy Do We Use?](https://github.com/aathira-p/SQL-Data-Expoloration-Projects/blob/main/SQL_data_exploration1.sql)

This data is used from [Energy-data](https://ourworldindata.org/energy) contains primary energy consumption per person across the world. It helped me practice 
1. Analyse the data and find the countries that has high consumption rate. 
2. Group the data according to continents 
3. Join tables with population data to find the total consumption in 2021 
4. Create *PIVOT* tables in SQL 
5. The analysed data was also visualized as a dashboard. 

*Check out the dashboard at Tableau Public!* : [Primary Energy Consumption per person](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aathira.prasad/viz/PrimaryEnergyConsumtionperperson_2/Dashboard1#1)
