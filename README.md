## Data Exploration of Covid Deaths and Vaccination Status using Bigquery 

The Covid-19 data from [Covid-data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) is analysed using BigQuery 
This helped me practice the following *skills* 
1. Create Project in Bigquery 
2. Upload Data 
3. Basic Query functions, CAST/CONVERT,
4. Perform and analyse simple calculations like percentage of covid deaths (grouped by locations) of the total cases, percentage of population vaccinated, Locations with highest infection rate etc. 
5. Join Tables 
6. Using CTE 
7. Create Tables
